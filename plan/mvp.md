# Project Name
Neuramancer

# Project Description
An application for collecting and organizing text, audio, and video notes into customizable groups, with descriptive instructions for usage. Users can create links to groups owned by others (via a friend-adding process requiring mutual approval) and assign labels to those links for comparative tracking.

# Project Objectives
## Understand fundamentals
- **Objective 1-1**: Grasp the core concepts of note collection, organization, and sharing in a multimedia context.
- **Objective 1-2**: Identify key data structures for grouping notes and handling permissions/links.

## Implement it in Rust with Dioxus
- **Objective 2-1**: Build a cross-platform user interface using the Dioxus framework to manage notes and groups efficiently.
- **Objective 2-2**: Leverage Dioxus for rendering multimedia content and integrating Rust-based logic for note organization and sharing.

## Solidify your Rust skills
Apply the Rust knowledge and best practices acquired throughout this program to build a robust and efficient multimedia notes application using Dioxus.

# Project Requirements
- **Requirement 1**: Support for creating, storing, and retrieving text, audio, and video notes, with organization into user-defined groups that include usage descriptions (e.g., tracking improvements in singing recordings).
- **Requirement 2**: Implement a secure linking system for sharing groups with other users, including a friend-approval process and custom labels for links (e.g., comparing progress against a friend's notes).

# Project Milestones
## Week 1
### Understand fundamentals
- **Fundamental 1**: Study multimedia file handling and data organization patterns in apps.
- **Fundamental 2**: Research permission models for collaborative sharing in note-taking systems.
### Brainstorm
Plan how to apply the Rust concepts and best practices you've learned in the program to this project, focusing on Dioxus for UI development.
### Experiment
Create small Rust programs with Dioxus to get ready.
### Notify your instructor
Inform your instructor on Discord that you have chosen this project.

## Week 2
### Milestone 2-1: Develop core note and group management
- **Task 2-1-1**: Implement structs for notes (text/audio/video) and groups with descriptions in Rust.
- **Task 2-1-2**: Add functionality to assign notes to multiple groups, integrated with Dioxus components.
### Milestone 2-2: Build Dioxus-based UI and storage
- **Task 2-2-1**: Set up persistent storage (e.g., using SQLite or file system in Rust) compatible with Dioxus.
- **Task 2-2-2**: Create a Dioxus-based UI for adding/viewing notes and groups, targeting web or desktop.

## Week 3
### Milestone 3-1: Integrate linking and approval features
- **Task 3-1-1**: Develop the friend-adding and approval mechanism for group links, using Dioxus for the interface.
- **Task 3-1-2**: Add label support for links and ensure multi-owner approvals, with UI feedback in Dioxus.
### Showcase progress
- Notify your instructor if youâ€™d like to showcase your work on Discord or during a live call.
- Share your progress on Discord and/or during a live call.

# Optional Enhancements
- **Optional enhancement 1**: Add search and analytics features to track improvements/regressions within groups, visualized using Dioxus components.
- **Optional enhancement 2**: Implement cloud synchronization for cross-device access to notes and linked groups, ensuring compatibility with Dioxus.
